# randompasswordgen

Description
This project is for self-improvement and practice in order to provide myself with confidence within this industry.

A Random Password Generator was created using Javascript.

This challenge provided me with the skills to use functions within JavaScript to have the end-user interact with the web application as intended.

Installation
To install the project, I've initiated my local working folder into a GitHub Repository, then pushed the local files to the Repository after adding and commiting the updated codes.
